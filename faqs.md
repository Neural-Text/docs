## Can I write full articles?

* Within the long-form smart copy tool, or within the content grader, use the _blog outline_ tool to generate the outline (h2, h3...)
* Once you have the outline, you can use the _bullet to paragraph_ tool: just pick each header of the outline and let the AI generate 7 possibile paragraphs for that headline (from which you can choose one or more in combination, whatever you prefer)
* If you want to expand a paragraph, you can choose the content expander: in this case you have to alternate writing with the AI. So you write a little, then expand with AI, then again write a little bit more...
