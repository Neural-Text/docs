<summary>Can I create an entire blog post with NeuralText?</summary>

Yes, when you are within the document editor:

1. &#x20;Use the _blog outline_ tool to generate an outline for the article
2. Once you have the outline, you can use the _bullet to paragraph_ tool for each header: just pick each item of the outline and let the AI generate some possibile paragraphs for that headline (from which you can choose one or more in combination, whatever you prefer).
