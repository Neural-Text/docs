# Integrations

NeuralText currently integrates with Google Docs via the add-on. Check out our [public roadmap](https://roadmap.neuraltext.com) to see which further integrations are under development!

### Google Docs add-on

Google Docs is a popular cloud word processor that can be used by anyone who has a Gmail account.

We have created an add-on to unleash all the power of NeuralText into Google Docs.

You don't need to login for using it, you have only to obtain a Shared Content Brief URL. In this way, you will be able to share a Content Brief with external collaborators.

You can find Google Docs add-on [**on Google Workspace Marketplace**](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/neuraltext/1030327384979).

**From the add-on you will be able to access:**

#### Relevant Terms

We extract common keywords from organic competitors to let you write about relevant topics. This table updates as you write.

#### Competitors

Here you will find your top organic competitors for the target keyword.
