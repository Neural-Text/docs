<summary>Google Docs add-on</summary>

Google Docs is a popular cloud word processor that can be used by anyone who has a Google account.

We have created an add-on to unleash all the power of NeuralText into Google Docs.

You don't need to login for using it, you have only to obtain a public Document URL. In this way, you will be able to share a document with external collaborators.

#### Get or create a public document URL

1. Open a document
2. Click on the gear icon in the sidebar - [Settings](getting-started/document-editor/sidebar/settings.md)
3. Check if the public URL is visible under the "Sharing" section
4. If it's not visible, click on the toggle and you will get the public document URL

To install the Google Docs add-on visits the[ **Google Workspace Marketplace**](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/neuraltext/1030327384979).

#### Google Docs add-on components

From the add-on you will be able to access:
