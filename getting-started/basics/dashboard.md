### AI Templates

Have you ever struggled with writer‚Äôs block?

We have.

That‚Äôs why we created AI templates. You can think a template as a use case: do you need to create an outline for your next presentation? That‚Äôs a template. You don‚Äôt how to start your next blog post? That‚Äôs another template.

We have trained an AI to generate content for a lot of different tasks, and we keep expanding and improving the model every week.

The recent AI Templates section will show your most used templates so you can continue working from where you left.
