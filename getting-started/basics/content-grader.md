The content score is a metric that helps you to know how your article compares to competitors when using our Google Docs Add-On for content optimization.&#x20;

The content score gives you a general score, from F to A, of your document. The score is based on reading scores, the presence of relevant terms and entities, and semantic similarity with the overall SERP results.
