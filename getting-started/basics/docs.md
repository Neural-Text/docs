# ðŸ“„ Document Editor

Documents are the core of the NeuralText experience. Itâ€™s where you will spend most of your time on the platform.

Documents are more flexible than templates and can provide an experience similar to Google Docs.

It is recommended to use documents for writing long-form content, like blog posts, emails, social posts, or books. In a later lesson, you'll learn how to use Docs.

Here is some of the things you can do in the documents:

* SERP analysis
* Content Brief
* Content Outline
* Writing using AI
* Optimizing your content
* Import any URL from the Internet
