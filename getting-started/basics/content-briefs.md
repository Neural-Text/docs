### Content Brief Components

Content Briefs are extremely useful when it comes to analyze what content is ranking for a keyword.

**Overview**

This section provides a bird's eye view on SERP data.

#### Search Volume

You have the search demand (showed as Search Volume or Search Trend, depending on the language set for content brief).\
The Country and Language are options set up during Project Creation.

#### People Also Ask

![](../../.gitbook/assets/9INjuMGWgFO8\_8tVm4itVMMgoaLgNxTaKg.png)

If the SERP has the People Also Ask widget, we will expand it up to 100 questions.\
PAA is useful to spot questions you should answer in your article or also to get some ideas for your next content.

#### SERP Widgets & Intents

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-06-04 at 01.57.13.png>)

These widgets are additional elements beyond traditional blue links on a SERP.\
SERP Widgets are also called “enriched search result” or “interactive rich result.”&#x20;

SERP intents define the user intent for that keyword.

#### SERP Intents

Search intent is the main purpose a user has when typing a query into a search engine.\
We use some signals from both the main query and the SERP results to give an approximation of what we think the user is likely to do.\
Use this information to understand quickly if the right content format is a long-form, or news, or visual.

#### Relevant Topics

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-06-04 at 01.54.50.png>)

Relevant Topics are suggested keywords you can use in your headings or in the title.

#### Questions

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-06-04 at 01.46.35.png>)

Use this section to find common questions you can answer to solve user problems. The sources of these data are Quora and Google Autosuggest.

#### SERP

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-06-04 at 01.57.51.png>)

This section shows all the organic results in Google First Page. You will end up with up to 20 results. This is absolutely normal: Google is decreasing the number of organic results to show its own SERP widgets.

* **Word Count** column is the number of words in the main content.
* **Internal Links** column represents the number of links pointing to the same domain in the main content.
* **External Links** column represents the number of links pointing to an external domain in the main content.

**Tip: **\
As a rule of thumb, if the average External Links is high, you can assume your competitors are writing highly educational content that requires detailed explanations.

#### Outlines

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-06-04 at 01.48.48.png>)

In this section you will find the header tags used by your competitors.\
This section is important to create an outline based on what is currently ranking.

#### Sources

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-06-04 at 01.49.17.png>)

It is important to include authoritative sources: we analyse all links found across top results and should be used for inspiration and factual information around the topic you are writing.

### Keep notes for your content brief
