# Keyword Research

Keyword research is the starting point of every content creation process, and as such is also a fundamental point. Our tool lets you retrieve a list of maximum 1000 keywords starting from just one.

The tool returns keywords containing exact match of the keyword you have inserted within the research bar, so depending on how specific is your input you could retrieve a much wider or shorter list of keywords.&#x20;

You will have all the keywords lists in the [Research History page](https://app.neuraltext.com/competitors/keyword/list/).
