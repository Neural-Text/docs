# 🗃 Projects

Projects are like folders where documents, keyword reports and generated texts live.

Projects are useful to keep your work organized across different clients or initiatives.

After logging in for the first time, you will be redirected to the Project selection page. After selecting the project, you will be redirected to the Dashboard page.

You can change the project in any time by just clicking on the button in the sidebar.
