### FAQ

### Why I have to write **text manually before generating text?**

To avoid the creation of content in an automated way, we have introduced this limit.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip:** To unlock the inline complete text function, you can paste in the editor some new content.
{% endhint %}
