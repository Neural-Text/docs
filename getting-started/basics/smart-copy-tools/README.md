### Step 1: Create a campaign

Go to [Create a New Campaign page](https://app.neuraltext.com/smartcopy/create-campaign/) and choose a name for your campaign and the language.

### Step 3: Describe your product

Insert the name of the product "Cloud X" and describe it in 2-3 sentences. You have to use at least 100 characters to generate results.

We will use this description: "The Privacy-First Smart Personal Cloud. Store your data locally and access it from anywhere with this smart personal cloud device."

**Tip:** If you want to use NeuralText like a pro and generate stunning copy, try to rephrase your description with as many details as possible. The results will blow your mind ü§Ø
