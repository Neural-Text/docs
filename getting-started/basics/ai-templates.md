# âš¡ AI Templates

Our 40+ AI templates are the building blocks of NeuralText.

Each one is designed to address very specific use cases, and they are very straightforward to understand and use. The next section will provide tips on how to make the most of them.

You can access the AI templates in two ways:

* On the left-hand side of your screen, click AI Templates > All Templates
* When inside a document, click on the icon with the four squares on the right sidebar.

### How to use AI templates

Let's say we want to create the copy for a product called Cloud X, a personal cloud device where you can store your personal data and access it from everywhere

#### Step 1: Select a Tool

Choose one of the available tools. For example, we want to create a _Facebook Ads Primary Text ._

#### Step 2: Describe your product

Insert the name of the product "Cloud X" and describe it in 2-3 sentences.

We will use this description: "The Privacy-First Smart Personal Cloud. Store your data locally and access it from anywhere with this smart personal cloud device."

{% hint style="info" %}
Basically, you want to provide the AI with the information required to generate content on your product. It can be as simple as taking a description from your site. Custom-written descriptions, however, are sometimes more effective. Take the time to test what works best.

Make sure you're being specific. You can help the AI generate better content by giving it clear, specific pointers it can latch onto. Try something different and see if it works better if you aren't happy with the results.
{% endhint %}

#### Step 3: Edit, save, delete, export

**Edit**

AI generated copy is not always ready to be published as-is, but it can give you some you want to refine.

Then you will be able to edit the generated content.
