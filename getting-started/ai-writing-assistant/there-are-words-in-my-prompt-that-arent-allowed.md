# ðŸ”ž There are words in my prompt that aren't allowed?

Despite our best efforts, we are severely limited in what words we can and cannot use to generate content. Our goal is to prevent misuse of the tool. Sometimes these restrictions include normal words like "blood".

Can you identify any words or terms in your prompt that you think might be misunderstood? You might want to consider rephrasing it. Should that still fail to fix the problem, feel free to send us the prompt and we'll assist you.
