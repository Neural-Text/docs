# âŒš Version Control

Many users used to keep multiple drafts of their documents in case they needed to refer to or switch from an earlier version.&#x20;

Now you can keep all your documents on NeuralText in one place. They are easily viewable and can be restored.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Examples**

> * View or revert to previous versions any time
> * You can access any version of your file at any time
> * You don't need to keep multiple drafts of your files anymore - keep it simple
{% endhint %}

#### View or revert to earlier versions of a document

You need to be the owner or the editor of the document to perform this action.

1. Open a document
2. Click on the **clock icon** in the editor sidebar
3. View a previous version of the file by clicking a timestamp. Below the timestamp you will see the email address of the user who edited the document
4. (Optional) To revert to this version, click Restore this version button.
