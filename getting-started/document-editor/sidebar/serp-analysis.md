# ðŸ”Ž SERP Analysis

When a document has a keyword associated, NeuralText will automatically perform a Google Search for that keyword and analyze all the pages ranking in the first 20 positions.

The data we got from these pages are organized in a section called SERP Analysis.\
You can find these data in the sidebar under the magnifier icon.
