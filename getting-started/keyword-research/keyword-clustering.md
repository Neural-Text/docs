# üçá Keyword Clustering

NeuralText Keyword Clustering tool is a grouping tool that does the dirty job for you, speeding up the keyword research phase and giving you a content strategy in just few minutes.

This tool analyses SERP for each keyword you provide, and is able to cluster together keywords based on the semantic similarity and ranked URLs.

As a result, you will obtain an output file with main keyword and variations of this keyword, from which you can create just one article to rank them all. This algorithm is based on the strong assumption that similar keywords that produce the same ranking for your competitors are more likely to be ranked with just one article.

The purpose of keyword grouping tool is to generate clusters of keywords that are more likely to rank together with just one article.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example**: you submit 3000 keywords, and you obtain 150 groups (clusters) of keywords.\
\
Ideally, you should write an article for each group of keywords, and in every article you should use all the keywords of the cluster in order to increase the likelihood of that one single article to be ranked for all the keywords corresponding to its cluster. \
\
Every cluster has a main keyword, which is the keyword with the highest volume amongst the keywords present in that group.
{% endhint %}

Use the keyword in the variations column as section headings or as synonyms for the main keyword.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You don't need to include all the variations in your article! Use the common sense and don't stuff keywords.
{% endhint %}
